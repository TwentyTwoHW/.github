## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

![TwentyTwo Devices Banner](https://github.com/TwentyTwoHW/.github/blob/master/profile/banner.svg?raw=true)

At TwentyTwo we build cypherpunk devices for Bitcoiners.

We make Portal, the first mobile-native hardware wallet, which is also completely open-source: in this organization you'll find both the [hardware schematics](https://github.com/TwentyTwoHW/portal-hardware) and the monorepo containing the [firmware and the supporting libraries](https://github.com/TwentyTwoHW/portal-software).

We also open source useful tools and bits of code, to learn more check out the [list of repositories](https://github.com/orgs/TwentyTwoHW/repositories).
